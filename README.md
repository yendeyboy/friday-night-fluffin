# Hello there!

yeah this is the source code for Friday Night Fluffin


## Tips for tha Newbies

idk if anyone in the team used Github before so ima make a short tutorial cuz im bored


* First download the [**Github Client**](https://desktop.github.com/)

* Then sign in 

* Open the private repo link, click on the **Green "Code"** button and click "Open with Github Desktop"

* choose where to store the repo and stuff

* wait. it's gonna take a long ass time *(well for me atleast)* so do something while it downloads the repo

* open the repo folder with VS Code and you're done

## Now what?

well copy your repo and paste it to this repo (which is the folder that has the same name as this repo)

then go to Github Client and you see there is check mark and a button saying "Commit to **main**". 

add a commit name (the text tab thing next your profile)

and click commit ***(Warning: Just make sure your changes are finished and the source code is Up to date. if you want to know how to make source code up to date go further this page)***

## How to Update Source Code?

***(Warning again: Make a backup of repo folder before doing this. just in case if Github client go oopsies)***

Open the Github Client and there will be a button called **"Fetch origin"** 

click it and wait for a bit

then this is might be the **hard part**

it will gives you error(s) that says if you need to keep the change you or not of a part of a code.

you have two options

* replace it with the incoming change (changes made by other coders)
* keep the current change (changes that are in your code currenty)

just keep the incoming changes that are not made by you and keep a current change if you want it for later

Yup thats it
